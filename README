Hash-AutoHash-AVPairsSingle

This is a subclass of Hash::AutoHash which wraps a tied hash whose
elements are simple values like numbers and strings, not
references. Hash::AutoHash::Record uses this class to represent
attribute-value pairs parsed from text
files. Hash::AutoHash::AVPairsMulti is similar but allows each
attribute to have multiple values.
